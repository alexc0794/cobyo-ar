# Cobyo AR - Bringing Augmented Reality to Fashion

Wear the cover art of the song you're currently listening to! Thanks to AR marker tracking technology and QR codes, anyone with a QR code capable phone can see what you're vibing to.

### Point camera at AR marker (the QR code is the marker)
Make sure that the marker is flat, and the lighting is not too bright. Works best when marker is less than 6 ft away.

### Once marker is detected, currently playing song appears
If the wearer has not authorized public permission to view their music, the viewer will see an error.
